**What is Naive Bayes classifiers?**
- Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem.
  It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.

- One of the most simple and effective classification algorithms, the Naïve Bayes classifier aids in the rapid development of machine learning models with rapid prediction capabilities.

- The “Naive” part of the name indicates the simplifying assumption made by the Naïve Bayes classifier.
  The classifier assumes that the features used to describe an observation are conditionally independent, given the class label.
- The “Bayes” part of the name refers to Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician and theologian who formulated Bayes’ theorem.
